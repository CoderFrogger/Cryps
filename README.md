# Cryps

Cryps is an old cypher program I made a while ago. It takes text and encrypts it. Each letter is represented by a 3 digit sequence begining with `0` (spaces are represented by `000`), the exact conversion can be found in `cryps.go`

Simply build the program, run the executable and follow the CLI instructions. You can convert text to cypher and cypher to text
